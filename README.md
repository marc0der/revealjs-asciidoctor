## It's a bird. It's a plane. It's SDKMAN!

These are the slides for my talk on SDKMAN!

They are written using Asciidoc, and can be rendered to to html in Reveal.js using Asciidoctor.

Check out the project and run the following:

    node asciidoctor-reveal.js

This will produce a _presentation.html_ file.

This file has already been checked in for convenience.
