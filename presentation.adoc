== About the Talk

* Problem and Solution
* What is an SDK?
* Architecture
* Infrastructure
* Vendoring
* Contribution
* Future

== DEMO!!!

== Itchy Scratchy

=== Problem

[%step]
* Working with many SDKs
* Downloading SDKs
* Extracting SDKs
* Manage many `_HOME` variables
* Adding these to `PATH`
* Simlinks to switch versions
* A Mundane Task!
* *A Pain in the Ass!!*

=== Solution

[%step]
* An SDK Manager
* Install multiple Candidates
* Multiple Versions per Candidate
* Performs Downloads
* Deals with Archives
* Handle `_HOME` and `PATH` variables
* Notifications
* Always up to date
* Runs anywhere

== SDK WTF?

=== What is an SDK?

[%step]
* archive: `.zip` or `.tar.gz`
* containing folder: `${name}-${version}/`
* unix folder sub-structure: `/bin`, `/lib`, `/etc` etc.
* self contained

=== What is a Package?

[%step]
* artifact: `.deb`, `.rpm`, `.dmg`, `.pkg`, `.exe`
* complex folder structure
* internal descriptors, scripts
* custom for distro, platform
* external dependencies

=== Package or SDK Manager?

== CLI Architecture
[%step]
* Currently in BASH
* Rewrite in Go

=== Why in bash?
[%step]
* Light weight
* Fast startup (no Java)
* Many platforms (OSX, Linux, Cygwin, Solaris, BSD)
* No dependencies (only Curl, Zip)

[background-video="quicksand.mp4",background-video-loop=true,background-video-muted=true]
=== But, it's like building on Quicksand!

=== Why use Go instead?
[%step]
* Consistent behaviour
* Native LLVM
* Multi platform
* No dependencies _at all_
* Powerful standard libs

== Backend Architecture

* Microservices
* Docker
* NGINX
* MongoDB
* Postgres

=== API Services

* Proxy Service
* https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-candidates[Candidate Service]
* https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-hooks[Hooks Service]
* https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-broker[Broker Service]
* https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-candidates[Broadcast Service]

=== Infrastructure

* Digital Ocean
* Docker Hub
* Terraform
* Ansible
* Kubernetes?

== Vendoring

* Vendor APIs

* https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-vendor-maven-plugin[SDKMAN Vendor MVN Plugin]
* https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-db-migrations[Database Migrations]

== What does the future hold?

=== Go Rewrite

[%step]
* bash wrapper
* small iterations
* use cucumber features
* fully feature compliant
* Go CLI will speak JSON
* release v3 JSON API
* offline by default! (like apt or git)

=== Java Candidate

[%step]
* custom list view
* JVM vendor namespace
* hooks backend migrate to Go CLI?

=== New Features

[%step]
* Official Docker images (https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/375[Issue #375])
* Major version alias (https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/603[Issue #603])
* System installation fallback (https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/673[Issue #673])
* Per project SDK configuration (https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/683[Issue #683])
* Offer available version when version ommitted (https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/689[Issue #689])
* Clean up commands (https://github.com/sdkman/sdkman-cli/issues/688[Issue #688])
